Google Translation  Project - Telugu Wikipedia data analysis

This project contains all the files required. This uses the ProjectTemplate package
for organising the files.


To load this  project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated
messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:
* Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
* Loading any R packages you listed in he configuration file.
* Reading in any datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
* Preprocessing your data using the files in the `munge` directory.

You'll have access to all of your data, already fully preprocessed, and
all of the libraries you want to use.

Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like by loading the relevant 
scripts. 

For the analysis already done, browse the relevant pdf files produced from Rmd files.
